<p class="meta">19 Jun 2015 - San Francisco</p>

Over the last year I've had a chance to learn a lot more about early stage
funding and made angel investments in a handful of startups. So far I've
restricted my involvement to companies with ideas in which I have significant
domain knowledge. I also insist on founders with relentless product focus, a
fierce desire to help their customers be more awesome, and excellent
communication skills. I recently met just such a company, with just such
founders, tackling a problem that has personally caused me much pain.

The company is [Replicated](http://replicated.com), and founders Grant Miller
and Marc Campbell are making it easier to roll out an on-prem Enterprise
offering based on an existing cloud-based SaaS product.
